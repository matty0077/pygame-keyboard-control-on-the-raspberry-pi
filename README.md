A quick snippet of pygame code that contains what youd need for keyboard control to be applied in any python code.

with an example that is applied to my custom adafruit 16 channel servo hat control to control up to 16 servos with your keyboard

in case your wondering, the code in the fuchikoma was put together for a bionic prosthetic i built that plays guitar ;)

the list of key commands can be found here: https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/key.html
